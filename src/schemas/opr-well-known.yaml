# Schema for the OAuth protected resource server .well-known json object
$schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
type: object
properties:
  resource:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Identifier for the protected resource. This MUST be a URL using the `https` scheme
      and MUST NOT include a fragment component. It is RECOMMENDED that this URL does
      not include a query component, but using one is permitted if necessary for
      resource identification. (See [Reference to relevant spec, e.g., RFC XXXX Section 1.2]
      for the formal definition).
    format: uri
  authorization_servers:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the Issuer Identifiers ([RFC8414]) of the OAuth Authorization
      Servers that can authorize access to this protected resource. The resource MAY omit
      some supported authorization servers from this list. If the set of supported
      authorization servers is not enumerable or discoverable via this mechanism,
      this parameter SHOULD be omitted.
    items:
      type: string
      format: uri
  jwks_uri:
    type: string
    description: >-
      URL of the protected resource's JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set) [RFC7517] document.
      This document contains public keys owned by the protected resource, potentially
      including keys used for signing resource responses (e.g., according to
      [Reference to FAPI Message Signing spec]). This URL MUST use the `https` scheme.
      If the JWK Set contains keys for both signing (`sig`) and encryption (`enc`),
      the `use` (public key use) parameter is REQUIRED for each key to declare its
      intended purpose.
    format: uri
  scopes_supported:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] scope values supported by this
      protected resource for requesting access. The resource MAY omit some supported
      scope values from this list.
    items:
      type: string
  bearer_methods_supported:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the methods supported by the protected resource for receiving
      OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens [RFC6750]. Valid values are `"header"`, `"body"`, and
      `"query"`, corresponding to Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of RFC 6750, respectively.
      An empty array `[]` indicates that Bearer Tokens transmitted using these methods
      are not supported. Omission of this parameter implies no defaults and indicates
      nothing about supported methods.
    items:
      type: string
      enum: [header, body, query]
  resource_signing_alg_values_supported:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the JWS [RFC7515] signing algorithms (`alg` values) [RFC7518]
      supported by the protected resource for signing its responses (e.g., as described
      in [Reference to FAPI Message Signing spec]). Omission of this parameter implies
      no default algorithms. The value `"none"` MUST NOT be included in this list.
    items:
      type: string
  resource_name:
    type: string
    description: >-
      A human-readable name for the protected resource, suitable for display to end-users.
      Inclusion of this field is RECOMMENDED. The value MAY be internationalized
      (e.g., using language tags as specified in [Reference to relevant spec, e.g., RFC XXXX Section 2.1]).
  resource_documentation:
    type: string
    description: >-
      URL of a web page providing human-readable documentation for developers about
      using this protected resource. The target content MAY be internationalized
      (e.g., as specified in [Reference to relevant spec, e.g., RFC XXXX Section 2.1]).
    format: uri
  resource_policy_uri:
    type: string
    description: >-
      URL of a web page detailing the protected resource's policy regarding client
      usage of the data it provides. The target content MAY be internationalized
      (e.g., as specified in [Reference to relevant spec, e.g., RFC XXXX Section 2.1]).
    format: uri
  resource_tos_uri:
    type: string
    description: >-
      URL of a web page specifying the protected resource's terms of service. The
      target content MAY be internationalized (e.g., as specified in [Reference to relevant spec, e.g., RFC XXXX Section 2.1]).
    format: uri
  tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Boolean value indicating whether the protected resource supports mutual-TLS
      client certificate-bound access tokens [RFC8705]. If omitted, the default
      value is `false`.
    default: false
  authorization_details_types_supported:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the `type` values supported by the resource server for
      the `authorization_details` parameter defined in [RFC9396].
    items:
      type: string
  dpop_signing_alg_values_supported:
    type: array
    description: >-
      A JSON array listing the JWS `alg` values (from the IANA "JSON Web Signature
      and Encryption Algorithms" registry [IANA.JOSE]) supported by the resource
      server for validating DPoP proof JWTs [RFC9449].
    items:
      type: string
  dpop_bound_access_tokens_required:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      Boolean value indicating whether the protected resource requires DPoP-bound
      access tokens [RFC9449] for all authorized requests. If omitted, the default
      value is `false`.
    default: false # Explicitly adding default for clarity.
  signed_metadata:
    type: string
    description: >-
      A JWT [RFC7519] containing metadata parameters about the protected resource
      as claims. The value is the JWT itself, represented as a string. This
      `signed_metadata` parameter itself SHOULD NOT appear as a claim within the
      signed JWT; metadata containing such a claim SHOULD be rejected.

  # --- ZETA/ASL Custom Parameters ---

    type: string
    description: >-
      Indicates whether and how the ZETA/ASL protocol is utilized by this resource server.
      `not_supported`: ZETA/ASL is not used or supported.
      `required`: ZETA/ASL is mandatory for interaction with this resource server.
