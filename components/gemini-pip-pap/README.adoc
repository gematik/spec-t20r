= gemini-pip-pap

This gemini-pip-pap is intended for local development and testing. It is not intended for production use.
The code was created to compare code generation capabilities of ChatGPT and gemini.

Conclusion: it's almost the same code. ChatGPT seems to create code with less problems than gemini.
Some "ideas" in the gemini code are useful. Sometimes it could help to use both tools.
